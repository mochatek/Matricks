## Instructions

- We start with a 8x8 grid where one of the cell will contain a hidden treasure 💰
- The object is to find that treaure
- Click the cell to reveal its content
- Once the treasure is found, we progress to next level ⬆️
- At each new level the grid narrows to n-1 in size
- Total points earned from each level = (total cells - number of wrong cells opened)

**_Make your guesses right -> Score maximum points!_**
